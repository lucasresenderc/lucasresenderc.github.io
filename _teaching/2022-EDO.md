## Classes

### Class 00

* Write a very simple Octave code to solve the equation x' = x(1-x) and the logistic equation using the Euler Method.

### Class 01

* Separate the code in two files, one with a general Euler Method to be used with any equation x' = F(t,x) and one with an example of use for the Lotka-Volterra equation.

### Class 02 (as homework)

* Implement two functions to solve integrals.
