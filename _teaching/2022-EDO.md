## Classes

### Class 00

* Write a very simple Octave code to solve the equation x' = x(1-x) and the logistic equation using the Euler Method. See [Octave codes](/files/).

### Class 01

* Separate the code in two files, one with a general Euler Method to be used with any equation x' = F(t,x) and one with an example of use for the Lotka-Volterra equation. See [Octave codes](/files/).

### Class 02 (assignment)

* In section 2.6 of our book (page 62) the Picard method is introduced. It consists of an iterative method to locally solve a differential equation x'=F(x,y). The goal is to construct a sequence $(\gamma_n: (t_0-\varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon) \to \mathbb{R}^d)_{n=0}^\infty$ such that $\gamma_n$ converges uniformly (and exponentially fast) to a solution.
* The method stats with $\gamma_0(t) \equiv x_0$ and then we iterate $\gamma_{n+1}(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t F(s, \gamma_n(s)) ds$ for $n \geq 1$.
* A numerical method to solve Picard clearly depends on a numerical method to solve integrals. Two such methods are the rectangle rule and the trapezium rule (in the book). Better approximations can be achieved with the [1/3 Composite Simpson's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule).
> The assignment tasks are: 
> - Read section 2.6 and the wiki page on Simpson's rule;
> - Create 3 .m files called *IntegralRectangleRule.m*, *IntegralTrapezoidalRule.m* and *IntegralSimpsonsRule.m*;
> - Each file must have a function
>> <code>function integral = IntegralSomethingRule(times, curve, F)
<br> # times is a list of times s (with n
 entries)
<br> # curve is a n by d matrix, the i-th row corresponds to the i-th time
<br> # F(s,x) is a real-valued function taking a real s and a d-dimensional vector x. 
</code>
>
> - Create another .m file called *IntegralExamples.m* giving examples of use for the 3 rules;

* Due date <strong>April 3rd, 2022</strong>. Send to [lucas.resende@impa.br](mailto:lucas.resende@impa.br) as a .zip or .rar file containing all 4 .m files (name it *YOURFULLNAME.zip* or *YOURFULLNAME.rar*, no spaces), as subject use *(YOURFULLNAME) - ASSIGNMENT: INTEGRATION RULES*.
* The assignment <strong>will not</strong> be evaluated, but I'll give feedback on your code. It is just a task to see how you are going. But I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to do it, since it is a good way to test your code skills up to now.
