In Prediction, Learning and Games (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006) an algorithm is presented for the following problem: "given n advisors and their advices over time, how to use their recommendations in a optimal way (to be defined)?". Then, they use their algorithm to provide an alternative and beautiful proof for the minimax theorem. We will follow their steps.
