I am a Brazilian (b. 1997, Minas Gerais - Brazil) PhD Candidate in Probability at IMPA. My research interests lie in the intersection (maybe 2 by 2) between Probability, Statistics and Optimization. I have a B.Sc. in Computational Math from UFMG (2018) and a M.Sc. in Math from UFMG (2020). I am also interested in applied math and consulting, previous consulting clients include the cargo sector of the BH International Airport and the food company Empório São João.

Besides Math, I have a growing interest in agroecological farms and their tecnologies (mainly in the theory and practice of [Ernst Gotsch](https://agendagotsch.com/en/)).
